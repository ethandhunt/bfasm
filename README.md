weird brainfuck assembly language compiler and stdlib

## file extensions
  `.bf` - raw brainfuck file, runnable in other brainfuck interpreters
  
  `.bfpy` - brainfuck compiled into python code, runs in python
  
  `.bfasm` - whole repo centers around this, it's a language loosely based on assembly (very loosely)
